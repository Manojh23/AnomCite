For dataset please email me I can send you the zipped file as it is too huge to upload on github.
Please use your own openai api key to detect whether it is anomalous or not. 



The first file is used to extract citation context from a pdf and store the results in a csv which has  the results of  the number of times a particular reference has been cited in the paper and also all the citation contexts of that particular paper along with the title of the paper and the author names.
The second file is used to find whether the particular self citation is anomalous or not based on the citation context and summaries of the paper.
This summary has been generated using llm again but that code has not been uploaded over here.
