    "            Passage:The stretch results of LocalHeur outperforms DeltaHeur almost always by an additive factor of 2. The cost of achieving this is minimal, considering that in all cases only at most 10 percent of the nodes deviate from their best-response (Table 1) and the deviation from best-response is only about 3 percent, which can be inferred by the constant shown in the average closeness to equilibrium plot (Figure 6). This is consistent with Theorem 7..1. For power p = 2, the performance becomes comparable to DeltaHeur, but still there are only 10 percent of nodes deviating, and the worst case deviation is a very slowly growing function consistent with the theoretical upper-bound from Theorem 7..2. An explanation for comparable stretch and diameter results upon powering the distance is that SPT tends to choose shorter edges Algorithms 2009, 2 1319 at higher powers [26] thus tending towards closer neighbor, while the choice of the next forwarding neighbor in the case of LocalHeur remains the same for all powers. For the random link models under both social cost functions, both DeltaHeur and MST prices appear growing, though for the stretch-based pricing (Figure 8), again MST appears growing asymptotically faster, and there is too much variance in the DeltaHeur plot to make further inferences. The primary consistent observation applying here is that the DeltaHeur is still an improvement over MST (whether by a constant or asymptotically growing factor), and that the md-prices are still quite small.

    " [11, Theorem 5.1] prove that for any arbitrary vector w, the Social Cost of any Nash equilibrium is within 2max/avg(w)(1 + Îµ) of that of the fully mixed Nash equilibrium, for any constant Îµ > 0. Combined with our upper bounds on the Coordination Ratio restricted to the fully mixed Nash equilibrium (Theorems 5.6, 5.6, and 6.6) this implies corresponding upper bounds (multiplied by 2max/avg(w)(1 + Îµ)) on Coordination Ratio for the general case. The fully mixed Nash equilibrium conjecture was recently disproved in [6] for the case of arbitrary users and uniform capacities. It is an interesting open problem whether the conjecture holds for the case of identical users and arbitrary capacities. Finally, conjectures motivated by and similar to the Fully Mixed Nash Equilibrium Conjecture were recently formulated and studied in an intensive way for several variants of the KP model [4], [8], [9], [17], [19]. For an advocate of conjectures related to the fully mixed Nash equilibrium, we refer the reader to the recent survey [12]. Two independent research teams, one of Koutsoupias et al. [15] and another of Czumaj andV Ìˆocking[3],havesubsequentlybounded(inanonconstructiveway)theCoordination Ratio to be ï¿½(lg m/lg lg m) for the model of uniform capacities and arbitrary traffics. Their corresponding, nonconstructive proofs have not identified the worst-case Nash equilibrium [16] for this model-they have only provided a tight upper bound for any Nash equilibrium (and, therefore, for the worst-case one).\n",

    " For the lâˆž norm and a natural subclass of equilibria, which we call subpath-optimal, the price of anarchy in singlecommodity networks is no worse than that in the l1 case. The bicriteria bound of [23] also holds for this subclass of equilibria. Again, these upper bounds are the best possible. We next compare and contrast these contributions with other results in the literature. Our positive result for subpathoptimal equilibria is reminiscent of â€œprice of stabilityâ€ analyses that concern the best equilibrium of a game [1, 2, 10], but it is much stronger. The best equilibrium of a game typically cannot be reached without centralized intervention, 2 NETWORKS-2012-DOI 10.1002/net but subpath-optimal equilibria are the natural outcome of decentralized optimization from a networking perspective: if an equilibrium is computed by a distributed shortest path routing protocol, it is automatically subpath-optimal (see Section 3.2). The separation that we prove between the worst-case price of anarchy in single-commodity and multicommodity networks with the lp norm with p > 1 stands in contrast to the case of the l1 norm, where there is never such a separation [10,20]. Indeed, all previously known proof techniques for bounding the price of anarchy of selfish routing (for the l1 norm) neither refer to the number of commodities of a network nor to any combinatorial structure whatsoever (as made precise in [22]). These proof techniques for the l1 case therefore appear incapable of extending to the lp case with p > 1-our results require a new and fundamentally combinatorial approach.\n",

    "The paper establishes that in every instance of the network design problem with Shapley cost-sharing, there exists a Nash equilibrium whose total cost is at most H(k) times the optimal cost, where H(k) is the harmonic sum.

    "Source paper summary:\n",
    "This research delves into the concept of \"price of anarchy\" in network routing, focusing on the scenario where the cost of a path is determined by its most congested edge (the bottleneck) using the â„“âˆž norm aggregation function. This contrasts with traditional approaches where path costs are calculated as the sum of edge costs (â„“1 norm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors demonstrate that for a natural cost-minimization objective, the price of anarchy with endogenous traffic rates (where demand fluctuates based on congestion) is no larger than in networks with fixed demand. This upper bound holds for the â„“âˆž path cost when considering equilibria generated by distributed shortest path routing protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper then explores the price of anarchy in multicommodity networks, where multiple commodities compete for network resources. It establishes a separation between the worst-case price of anarchy in single-commodity and multicommodity networks with the â„“p norm (where p>1), unlike the â„“1 norm where such separation doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study examines a broader objective that minimizes the travel cost of participating players and the lost benefit of non-participating players, analogous to \"prize-collecting\" objectives in approximation algorithm design. The authors introduce the Pigou Bound, which minimizes the combined cost over all feasible flow paths that are not routed at a specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the paper presents examples highlighting the unbounded nature of the price of anarchy in multicommodity networks with nonlinear aggregation functions, even with linear cost functions and inelastic traffic. It also demonstrates that the bicriteria bound, which states that a Nash flow is no more expensive than an optimal flow at double the traffic rates, doesn't hold for the â„“âˆž path norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research then investigates subpath-optimal equilibria, a natural outcome of decentralized optimization from a networking perspective. It identifies a \"minimal cut\" with respect to a subpath-optimal Nash flow and argues that proof techniques must leverage both the subpath assumption and the combinatorial structure of single-commodity networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper extends its analysis to the â„“p path norms, proving a bicriteria bound for the â„“p norm and demonstrating that the worst-possible inefficiency arising from the tragedy of the commons is no greater than that arising from routing inefficiency. Finally, it concludes by showing that all bounds on the price of anarchy extend to networks with elastic traffic, highlighting the practical implications of this research for network optimization and performance analysis.\"\"\""

For individual instances the resulting gap using the standalone VNS increases up to 24.89%.

The proposed VNS method outperforms existing solutions in the literature and is particularly effective for larger instances.\n",

    "The research also examines the Periodic Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP), a special case of the PVRP with a single vehicle available each day. The adapted VNS approach for the PTSP also demonstrates competitiveness. The paper highlights two key contributions: the first application of VNS to periodic routing problems and the demonstration of its effectiveness through computational results.\n",

    "The VNS algorithm incorporates move and cross-exchange operators to explore different neighborhoods and overcome local optimality. These operators alter the sequence of customer visits within routes.

The MILP formulation models the problem of minimizing total cost, considering travel time and penalties for delays between unloading operations. The VNS component focuses on selecting variables to fix, employing a very large neighborhood search (VLNS) strategy. These hybrid metaheuristics outperform the pure VNS approach. \n",

    " Indeed MSSC is sometimes called the k-means problem. This heuristic alternately applies properties (ii) and (iii) above until a local optimum is reached. It has been shown by Hansen and Mladenovi Ìc [25] that while k-means usually gives good results for small number of clusters its performance deteriorates, sometimes drastically, when this number increases. Modifying k-means by adding a jump move of a centroid to an entity location gives a much better heuristic called j-means. Finally, combining j-means with a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) heuristic [26,27,47] gives a heuristic which often provides optimal solutions or best known ones. This empirical observation will be exploited in the algorithm presented below. Other recent heuristics for MSSC include the global k-means method of Likas et al.

    "The stretch results of LocalHeur outperforms DeltaHeur almost always by an additive factor of 2. The cost of achieving this is minimal, considering that in all cases only at most 10 percent of the nodes deviate from their best-response (Table 1) and the deviation from best-response is only about 3 percent, which can be inferred by the constant shown in the average closeness to equilibrium plot (Figure 6). This is consistent with Theorem 7..1. For power p = 2, the performance becomes comparable to DeltaHeur, but still there are only 10 percent of nodes deviating, and the worst case deviation is a very slowly growing function consistent with the theoretical upper-bound from Theorem 7..2. An explanation for comparable stretch and diameter results upon powering the distance is that SPT tends to choose shorter edges Algorithms 2009, 2 1319 at higher powers [26] thus tending towards closer neighbor, while the choice of the next forwarding neighbor in the case of LocalHeur remains the same for all powers. For the random link models under both social cost functions, both DeltaHeur and MST prices appear growing, though for the stretch-based pricing (Figure 8), again MST appears growing asymptotically faster, and there is too much variance in the DeltaHeur plot to make further inferences. The primary consistent observation applying here is that the DeltaHeur is still an improvement over MST (whether by a constant or asymptotically growing factor), and that the md-prices are still quite small.

    "This paper examines the Locally Minimum Cost Forwarding Game (LMCF) in wireless networks, where nodes selfishly choose forwarding paths to minimize their individual costs. The paper focuses on determining the optimal Nash equilibrium, a state where no node can improve its situation by unilaterally changing its strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors prove the hardness of computing the optimal Nash equilibrium for LMCF in three-dimensional Euclidean instances, as well as approximation hardness for arbitrary instances. They propose a heuristic algorithm, the Delta Heuristic, for finding Nash equilibria and analyze its performance through simulations and probabilistic arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper highlights key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Existence of Nash Equilibria:** Nash equilibria always exist in LMCF, with minimum spanning trees being one example.\n",
    "* **Price of Anarchy (PoA) and Stability:** The PoA, a measure of inefficiency caused by selfish behavior, and stability can be linear with respect to the stretch-based social cost objective.\n",
    "* **NP-Hardness and Inapproximability:** Finding the socially optimal Nash equilibrium is NP-hard, even in the three-dimensional Euclidean case. \n",
    "* **Properties of Nash Trees:** In any 2-dimensional Euclidean power graph, incoming node degree in a Nash tree is at most 6.\n",
    "* **Simulation Results:** Simulations demonstrate that the Delta Heuristic consistently outperforms directed Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) in LMCF, suggesting its practical usefulness for topology control in selfish wireless networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also discusses the expected PoA and PoS (Price of Stability) for random Euclidean power instances. It is found that the expected PoA is Ï‰(1), indicating a significant difference between the social cost of a Nash equilibrium and the optimal solution, while the expected PoS is Î˜(1), suggesting that a well-chosen Nash equilibrium can achieve a social cost comparable to the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors conclude that understanding the behavior of selfish nodes in LMCF is crucial for designing efficient and robust wireless networks. They propose the Delta Heuristic as a practical tool for achieving desirable outcomes in these settings.\n",

    "Source paper summary:\n",
    "This paper investigates the problem of all-to-one selfish routing in wireless sensor networks without a payment scheme. The goal is to minimize the total power consumed by transmitting messages from random sources to a single destination, modeled as a Locally Minimum Cost Forwarding (LMCF) game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The study focuses on characterizing the Nash equilibria and their global costs in terms of stretch and diameter.  It demonstrates the existence of Nash equilibria for the LMCF game, with minimum spanning trees being a common, though not always socially optimal, equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors explore the price of anarchy and price of stability, revealing potential linear increases in cost relative to social cost objectives.  They establish the NP-hardness of finding the socially optimal Nash equilibrium and demonstrate inapproximability results for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, heuristics are introduced: DeltaHeur and LocalHeur. DeltaHeur guarantees Nash equilibrium and exhibits good global performance, while LocalHeur, a local algorithm, prioritizes information locality in wireless sensor networks.  Both heuristics are compared to the Nearest Forward Progress (NFP) algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper analyzes the performance of these heuristics on Euclidean power graphs and random link graphs, considering factors like stretch and diameter.  It also explores the behavior of Nash equilibria in Euclidean graphs, focusing on the influence of mutual nearest neighbors and the impact of node density.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper further delves into the NP-hardness of approximating the optimal Nash equilibrium for both the SCmd and SCstretch social cost functions, providing a 3-SAT reduction and detailed analysis of the problem's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations conducted on Euclidean power graphs and random link models demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristics, with both DeltaHeur and LocalHeur surpassing the performance of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).  The paper also presents NS-2 simulations that validate the findings, demonstrating the energy efficiency of LocalHeur compared to MST in a realistic wireless environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper concludes by emphasizing the practical implications of LocalHeur for wireless sensor networks, highlighting its ability to approximate Nash equilibria while achieving near-optimal social cost. LocalHeur is positioned as a promising solution within the class of location-based routing methods, offering a balance between efficiency and robustness in the context of selfish routing.\"\"\""

    "Passage:\n",
    " Introduction For a graph G, the first and the second Zagreb indices, M1 and M2, respectively, are defined as M1 = M1(G) = uâˆˆV(G) d(u)2, M2 = M2(G) = uvâˆˆE(G) d(u)d(v), where d(u) denotes the degree of the vertex u of G.\n",
    "The Zagreb indices M1 and M2 were introduced in [12,13]. They reflect the extent of branching of an underlying molecular structure [1,12,13,15,28]. Their main properties were recently summarized in [3,8,16,25,32]. An important direction is determining graphs with maximal and minimal Zagreb indices in a given class of graphs. Indeed, over a significant class of graphs, the bounds for M1 and M2 were obtained (see [4,6,7,10,11,14,17-24,26,27,29-31]). Chen and Deng [5] studied the zeroth-order general RandiÄ‡ index, i.e., wÎ±(G) = âˆ‘ uâˆˆV(G) d(u)Î±, where Î± is a real number, for n-vertex bicyclic graphs. Deng [9] characterized the sharp bounds for the Zagreb indices, M1 and M2, of n-vertex bicyclic graphs. Motivated from these results, in this paper we continue to study the Zagreb indices of bicyclic graphs with given number of pendants. In this paper, we determine sharp upper and lower bounds for M1 and M2 for n-vertex bicyclic graphs with k-pendant vertices.\n",

    "The authors start by defining the Zagreb indices and then introduce graph-theoretical notation and terminology. They then explore the relationship between connectivity and Zagreb indices, specifically focusing on graphs with connectivity at most k. \n",

    "* **Theorem 2.1:** It establishes bounds for M1 and M2 of graphs with connectivity at most k.\n",
    "* **Theorem 2.4:** It shows that the maximum value of M1 for graphs with connectivity at most k is achieved by the complete graph Kkn.\n",
    "* **Theorem 2.5:** It proves that the minimum value of M1 for graphs with connectivity at most k is achieved by a specific graph G(1,n-k-1) which is obtained by connecting a single vertex to a complete graph of order (n-k-1).\n",
    "* **Theorem 2.6:** It establishes a relationship between the Zagreb indices and the connectivity of graphs, showing that M1 and M2 are closely related to the connectivity of the graph.\n",
    "* **Theorem 2.7:** It establishes bounds for M1 and M2 of connected graphs in Vkn, with k>0.\n",

    "The paper begins by defining the Zagreb indices and introducing bicyclic graphs, which are graphs with exactly two cycles.
